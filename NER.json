They create a boogeyman and then use politics and religion to make it seem like a greater threat (trans people, drag queens, sex education, immigrants) than it is and inspire people to vote. People who are afraid will sacrifice quite a lot in exchange for feeling safe and protected. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the DNC is using a similar strategy but trying to appeal to people\\'s consciences. If you don\\'t vote for us minority rights will be gone! If you don\\'t vote for us, the climate will suffer! If you don\\'t vote for us, you\\'re part of the problem! It\\'s intended to invoke the same kind of weaponized fear that the RNC is using but it\\'s working decidedly less than it did in the past (her own husband used fear to pass legislation during his Presidency).\\n\\nAs for why it\\'s not working? I think part of it is because Millenials grew up in the wake of 9/11, Columbine and increasing awareness of the climate crisis. We were just safe enough not to be desperate (like the cold war or great depression level of paranoia) where we\\'d exchange anything to feel safe. But just unsettled enough where we\\'ve never felt fully secure. We live in a constant suspended threat (climate change, mass shootings) and the promise of more future suspended threats has lost its bite. \\n\\nFor a lot of people, it just invokes a feeling of exhaustion and helplessness (apathy). Others who remain more motivated to see change (progressives) are increasingly beginning to lose faith in the system and think an overhaul is required for anything to change. Falling in line, getting with the status quo and trusting that the Democrats will help is no longer convincing. They want revolution. \\n\\nAdditionally, \\n\\nGen Z has even less reason to be inspired by fear-based rhetoric. They\\'ve grown up online and see constant atrocities and world threats and have had to learn to filter that information more than anyone before them. \\n\\nFear for whatever treason is still working really well for conservatives but not so much for liberals. And the DNC is too ancient to switch tactics. What they need to inspire in progressives is belief and trust. People need to believe that the DNC will protect the minority rights they pay lip service too. And also that the quality of life for so many milliennails who can\\'t afford a home will improve. Inspiration is great, but belief would be enough. For moderates they need to inspire a feeling of belonging.

For example, Biden proposes to do more to help Americans obtain student loans. Ever since becoming president, Biden has made student loan relief a priority, boasting that over 3.7 million Americans have had student debt canceled by his administration\u2019s actions. Only about 13 percent of Americans have student loan debt. That is hardly surprising, in 2022 because fewer than 38 percent of Americans have four-year college degrees, while only 14 per cent have a master\u2019s degree, doctorate, or professional degree. The majority of American adults have no formal education beyond high school, technical school, or some college.  Why not address auto loan debt that working-class people struggle to pay, instead of student loan debt for the relatively privileged economic elite? The answer is that the college-educated are a much higher percentage of the Democratic electorate (48 per cent) than of the American public (38 per cent). Moreover, women now outnumber men at American universities at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Seventy per cent of single women vote for Democratic candidates, while a majority of married women vote for Republicans. Biden\u2019s student loan program thus rewards a critical Democratic constituency.  But roughly half of American college graduates today have jobs that do not require college degrees. Why do Democrats like Biden want more young Americans to get useless diplomas? Here, too, the answer has to do with politics. University professors and administrators are one of the most Democratic constituencies in American society. In 2023, according to one survey, half of professors identify as liberal, 17 per cent as moderate, and 26 per cent as conservative.  More student loans therefore translate into more money for overwhelmingly-Democratic college faculty and staff, who in turn recycle the federal student loan money their institutions receive in part by donating predominantly to Democratic candidates. \"', 405: 'Attaboy Joe!', 406: 'How does one \u201ccancel\u201d 6 billion dollars?', 407: \"My wife had her $55K forgiven through PSLF, but I still owe $75K.

What I have actually said to them is when your leader says he can go out and do on 5th Avenue.. and do what he said he could do but he said he could do and not lose a single voter and you stay.. then there is something that happens to you that\\'s so deep you cannot fathom it until you\\'re empty and you look back and see that you\\'re empty.

It would be easy to set up a situation where they go in and do that again and disappear within minutes out of a secret back door or tunnel or whatever and be gone- toasting the Escape at the back door and get away before anybody realizes they\\'re gone. But anytime he had to leave the country and was under threat of losing in Congress or had a lawsuit coming out that would have devastated him and put him in jail he would do something similar every single time . Just before he left the country he would say something.. about nuclear whatever , to the reporters( usually while getting ready to get on a helicopter. ) When the Congress was undecided and  the votes are still being counted and could have gone either way, he had to be aware that could go either way when he went to Europe up for the World War II commemoration and the walk to the Tomb of the unknown soldier.

You\\'re really not going to win at the administrative hearing. So in most of those cases, you go to the admin hearing with your hat in hand and try to work it out.

A short while ago, Trump claimed to have about 400 million dollar in cash reserves. To post the bond, he\u00b4d have to put up another 65 million Dollar, not 450 million, as he claims. He posted a nearly 100 million Dollar bond recently in another case, underwritten by an insurance agency, which means, if he really tried, he\u00b4d be able to secure the bond. So there are several possible reasons, why Trump may not be able to post the legally required bond:\\n\\n1st: He squandered away so much of the 400 million dollar in such a short time, that the gap right now is significantly bigger. \\n\\nIf that is the case, the bond should have to be posted, because it is an indicator, there is a real risk, Trump might not be able to pay up after a lengthy appeal. This is true even more, since there are massive outstanding legal risks, threatening his capability to pay later.\\n\\n2nd: He has the money and could secure a bond for the missing 150 million, but that would mean, his cashflow would get severely restricted.\\n\\nIf this is the case, the bond should have to be posted, because he\u00b4d basically just doesn\u00b4t want to pay it and that is no reason at all. If anything, it makes it more pressing to have him post it, to ensure, he will have to comply with the law after appeal.\\n\\n3rd: He can and will post the bond, but is playing the book in order to reduce the amount or delay the effect.\\n\\nIf this is the case, he should be required to pay the bond, because the requirement exists exactly to stop this kind of behavior.\\n\\n  \\nAll things considered, it seems likely, that we will neither see his assets seized, nor the courts giving him a rich man discount. All we see is another attempt to rile up his base. But if he actually refuses to pay his dues, he should be treated as any average Joe and that means, to take, what he owes and hand it over to those, who have a right to it.', 2421: 'Dims always accuse others of exactly what they are doing.
